# AIResume Constraints Checklist ‚úÖ

## üìã Quick Reference

**For detailed section-level preservation rules, see:** [SECTION_PRESERVATION.md](SECTION_PRESERVATION.md)

### Key Principle
‚úÖ **ONLY Experience section bullets (in recent 1-2 roles) are modified**
‚ùå **Professional Summary, Technical Skills, Education, Contact Info - NEVER modified**

---

## Your Specific Requirements - Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: Section-Level Preservation (NEW!)**
- **Constraint:** Professional Summary, Technical Skills, Education, Contact Info NEVER modified
- **How:** AI prompt explicitly lists 7 sections that must remain 100% unchanged
- **Sections Preserved:**
  1. Professional Summary (word-for-word)
  2. Technical Skills (no additions/removals)
  3. Education (all details)
  4. Contact Information (all details)
  5. Certifications (if present)
  6. Publications (if present)
  7. Awards (if present)
- **Only Modifiable:** Experience section bullets in recent 1-2 roles ONLY
- **File:** `backend/resume_tailor.py:80-91`
- **Documentation:** See `SECTION_PRESERVATION.md` for detailed examples

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: Preserve All Projects and Roles**
- **Constraint:** Never delete or invent companies
- **How:** AI prompt explicitly states "NEVER INVENT COMPANIES/PROJECTS" and "NEVER DELETE PROJECTS/ROLES"
- **File:** `backend/resume_tailor.py:73-74`

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: Reuse Original Responsibilities**
- **Constraint:** Only adjust phrasing, don't fabricate
- **How:** Prompt instructs "REPHRASE BULLET POINTS: Reuse original responsibility wording, adjust phrasing to highlight relevant skills"
- **File:** `backend/resume_tailor.py:80`

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: No Technology Fabrication**
- **Constraint:** Do not add tech not present in original
- **How:** Prompt includes "NO TECHNOLOGY FABRICATION: Only mention technologies/tools that already exist in the original resume"
- **File:** `backend/resume_tailor.py:76`
- **Example:** If JD requires Kubernetes but you don't have it ‚Üí **AI will NOT add it**

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: Preserve Dates**
- **Constraint:** Project start/end dates unchanged
- **How:** "PRESERVE ALL DATES: Do not change any start dates, end dates, or date ranges"
- **File:** `backend/resume_tailor.py:75`

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: Tailor Only Recent 1-2 Projects**
- **Constraint:** Limit scope to recent projects
- **How:** Prompt specifies "ONLY IN {max_projects} MOST RECENT PROJECTS" (default: 2)
- **File:** `backend/resume_tailor.py:79`, `config.py:22`
- **UI Control:** Adjustable via sidebar slider (1-3 projects)

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: Maintain Bullet Count**
- **Constraint:** Keep bullets consistent (¬±1)
- **How:** "MAINTAIN BULLET COUNT: Keep same number of bullets (max ¬±1)"
- **File:** `backend/resume_tailor.py:83`

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: Emphasize Existing Strengths**
- **Constraint:** Focus on Snowflake, Databricks, Azure, MLflow, PySpark
- **How:** "EMPHASIZE EXISTING STRENGTHS: If resume mentions Snowflake/Databricks/Azure/MLflow/PySpark, emphasize these more prominently"
- **File:** `backend/resume_tailor.py:81`

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: No Advanced AI/ML Fabrication**
- **Constraint:** Don't add "LLM fine-tuning", "FSDP", etc. unless present
- **How:** "NO EXPERIENCE INVENTION: Do not add advanced methods (e.g., 'LLM fine-tuning', 'FSDP', 'model serving at scale') unless they're already present"
- **File:** `backend/resume_tailor.py:77`

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: Detailed Change Log**
- **Constraint:** Show what was modified
- **How:** Output includes detailed TAILORING SUMMARY with before/after comparison
- **Format:**
  ```
  - Original bullet: "..."
  - Modified to: "..."
  - Reason: Emphasized existing X to match JD
  **Technologies NOT Added:** [honest about gaps]
  **Factual Accuracy:** 100%
  ```
- **File:** `backend/resume_tailor.py:103-117`

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: Match Score Comparison**
- **Constraint:** Show before vs after scores
- **How:** UI displays initial score, then final score with improvement delta
- **File:** `app.py:217-235`
- **Display:** Side-by-side metrics with +X% improvement

### ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED: Example-Driven Prompt**
- **Constraint:** AI needs clear examples
- **How:** Prompt includes explicit example of correct tailoring:
  ```
  Original: "Developed data pipelines using Python and SQL"
  IF resume has Snowflake: "... with Snowflake and Databricks"
  IF resume doesn't have them: "Developed scalable data pipelines..." (no tech added)
  ```
- **File:** `backend/resume_tailor.py:86-90`

## üîç Verification Steps

### Before Using
1. ‚úÖ Read `SAFETY_FEATURES.md` - Understand constraints
2. ‚úÖ Ensure your original resume is accurate
3. ‚úÖ List all technologies you've actually used

### During Tailoring
1. ‚úÖ Upload accurate resume
2. ‚úÖ Review initial match score
3. ‚úÖ Wait 30-60 seconds for AI processing

### After Tailoring
1. ‚úÖ Read the TAILORING SUMMARY carefully
2. ‚úÖ Check "Technologies NOT Added" section
3. ‚úÖ Verify every modified bullet
4. ‚úÖ Ensure you can defend all claims in interview
5. ‚úÖ Download and review final resume

## üìä Expected Behavior Examples

### Scenario 1: You Have the Tech
- **Resume:** "Used Python and Snowflake"
- **JD Requires:** Snowflake, Databricks
- **Result:** Emphasizes Snowflake, does NOT add Databricks (you don't have it)
- **Change Log:** "Technologies NOT Added: Databricks"

### Scenario 2: Phrasing Adjustment
- **Resume:** "Built ML models"
- **JD Language:** "MLOps pipelines"
- **Result:** "Built MLOps-driven ML models" (same concept, JD terminology)
- **Reason:** You did ML, just using their language

### Scenario 3: Adding Context
- **Resume:** "Led Python development"
- **JD Requires:** "7+ years Python"
- **Result:** "Led Python development (7+ years experience)" (if you have it)
- **Reason:** Adding duration context, not fabricating

### Scenario 4: NOT Adding Missing Tech
- **Resume:** No mention of "Kubernetes"
- **JD Requires:** "Kubernetes experience"
- **Result:** NO change, does NOT add Kubernetes
- **Change Log:** "Technologies NOT Added: Kubernetes (not in original)"

## üéØ Match Score Reality Check

### Realistic Expectations
- **Before:** 60-75% (typical starting point)
- **After (honest tailoring):** 77-86%
- **Best case (you have most requirements):** 87-95%

### Warning Signs
- ‚ùå 100% match: Likely fabricated, suspicious to recruiters
- ‚ùå +30% improvement: Probably added fake experience
- ‚úÖ 82-86% match: Perfect - shows fit without red flags

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

### Adjust Tailoring Aggressiveness
**File:** `config.py`

```python
MAX_PROJECTS_TO_TAILOR = 2        # Modify 1-3 recent projects
BULLET_VARIATION_ALLOWED = 1      # Allow ¬±1 bullet
TARGET_MATCH_SCORE_MIN = 77       # Realistic minimum
TARGET_MATCH_SCORE_MAX = 95       # Realistic maximum
```

### Choose AI Model
**UI:** Sidebar dropdown

- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (recommended - most conservative)
- **GPT-4 Turbo** (good, slightly more creative)
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo** (faster, less conservative)
- **LLaMA 3.1 70B** (experimental)

**Recommendation:** Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for most accurate, conservative tailoring

## üìö Documentation Files

1. **README.md** - Installation and usage
2. **QUICKSTART.md** - 3-minute setup guide
3. **SAFETY_FEATURES.md** - Detailed safety explanation (read this!)
4. **CONSTRAINTS_CHECKLIST.md** - This file

## ‚úÖ Final Checklist Before Using

- [ ] I've read `SAFETY_FEATURES.md`
- [ ] My original resume is 100% accurate
- [ ] I understand the AI will NOT add technologies I don't have
- [ ] I'll review the change log after tailoring
- [ ] I can defend every claim in the tailored resume
- [ ] I'm okay with realistic match scores (77-86%), not 100%

## üöÄ Ready to Use

The app is running at: **http://localhost:8501**

Your resume will be tailored **conservatively and honestly** to emphasize your real strengths without fabrication.
