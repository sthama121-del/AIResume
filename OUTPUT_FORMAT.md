# Resume Output Format Requirements

## ‚úÖ **Critical: Clean, Professional Output Only**

The AI must output a **complete, recruiter-ready resume** with no meta-commentary.

---

## ‚ùå **INCORRECT Output Examples**

### Example 1: Meta-Text Preamble (WRONG)
```
I'll help tailor this resume for you. Here are the changes I'll make:
- Emphasize Snowflake experience
- Highlight MLOps skills
- Adjust terminology to match job description

JOHN DOE
john@email.com | 555-1234
...
```
**Problem:** Starts with explanation. Resume should start immediately with name.

### Example 2: Constraint Explanation (WRONG)
```
Based on your constraints, I will preserve the Professional Summary and Technical Skills sections while only modifying the Experience section bullets.

JOHN DOE
john@email.com | 555-1234
...
```
**Problem:** Includes meta-commentary about constraints.

### Example 3: Missing Sections (WRONG)
```
JOHN DOE
john@email.com | 555-1234

EXPERIENCE

[Education section missing]
[Professional Summary missing]
[Technical Skills missing]
```
**Problem:** Incomplete resume. All sections must be included.

---TAILORING SUMMARY---

**Sections Preserved (100% unchanged):**
- Professional Summary (word-for-word identical to original)
- Technical Skills (no additions - GenAI, Kubernetes NOT added despite JD requirement)
- Education (all details unchanged)
- Contact Information (all details unchanged)
- Certifications (unchanged)

**Roles Modified:** 2 (most recent only)
- AT&T - Senior Data Engineer: 4 bullets modified
- Cognizant - Data Engineer: 4 bullets modified

**Roles Preserved:** 1
- TCS - Junior Developer: 100% unchanged (older role outside top 2)

**Example Changes:**
- Original: "Developed ETL pipelines using Python and SQL"
- Modified: "Developed enterprise-scale ETL pipelines using Python (7+ years) and SQL, processing 10TB+ daily data volumes"
- Reason: Added "enterprise-scale" emphasis, highlighted years of experience, added quantifiable metric

- Original: "Built ML models for customer churn"
- Modified: "Built MLOps-driven machine learning models for customer churn prediction with Azure ML, improving retention by 15%"
- Reason: Used JD terminology "MLOps", emphasized Azure ML (already in skills), added impact metric

**Technologies NOT Added:**
- GenAI / Generative AI (required by JD but not in original resume)
- Kubernetes (required by JD but not in original resume)
- LLM fine-tuning (not in original resume)

**Factual Accuracy:** 100% - No fabricated experience. All technologies mentioned (Python, Snowflake, Azure, PySpark, MLflow) were already in the original Technical Skills section.
